Outside, Chicago's skyline was partially obscured by a low-hanging blanket of smog that had settled over the city like a dirty shroud.</p>
        <p>The harvester drone had entered through the classroom's ventilation systemâ€”a silent, nearly invisible mist that smelled faintly of ozone and something else... something medicinal. Most of her classmates didn't even notice it. But Anya did. She always noticed things others missed.</p>`,

        <p>The 12 Laws of Power is a razor-sharp guide to modern influenceâ€”where neuroscience, psychology, and ancient Vedic archetypes converge to give you the ultimate persuasion toolkit. This isn't about manipulation; it's about mastery: of perception, timing, emotion, and self.</p>
        <p>Whether you're leading a team, negotiating a deal, pitching a vision, or parenting a headstrong teen, power plays out in the shadows of attention and emotion. In this mind-opening book, Andrew J. Green shows you how to wield influence with surgical precisionâ€”without becoming the villain in your own story.</p>
        <p>Inside, you'll discover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The 12 universal laws that govern silent authority, trust engineering, and emotional leverage.</li>
            <li>Psychological tactics backed by behavioral science and case studies that feel too real to be theoretical.</li>
            <li>A hidden appendix containing the Nakshatra Influence Matrixâ€”a secret system for tailoring your approach to someone's cosmic psychological blueprint.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each chapter gives you tools. But more importantly, it gives you controlâ€”over outcomes, perception, and the person you are becoming.</p>
        <p>Don't chase power. Master the laws behind itâ€”and let the world move for you.</p>`,
